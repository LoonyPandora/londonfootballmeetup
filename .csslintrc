--ignore=unique-headings,important,fallback-colors


# Ignored Options
# ===============


# unique-headings
#   Headings should be defined only once.
#   A silly rule. Some styles are shared between headings, so should be specified once

# fallback-colors
#   Appears to be a bug in CSSLint - specifying transparent as a fallback doesn't work
#   Remove this option if/when that bug is fixed

# important
#   Useful in general, but we are using 3rd party markup
#   So in practice we really need to override their stuff
